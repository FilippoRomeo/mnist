# MNIST Digit Classification App

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end MNIST digit classification application designed for deployment on a self-managed server. It involves training a PyTorch model, creating an interactive front-end with Streamlit, logging predictions to a PostgreSQL database, and deploying the application using Docker and Docker Compose. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned based on user feedback to improve accuracy. The development environment is managed using Conda.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition**: A PyTorch model classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Users can draw digits in a Streamlit-based web app.
- **Prediction & Feedback**: The app provides model predictions with confidence scores, and users can submit correct labels for feedback.
- **Database Logging**: PostgreSQL stores predictions and user feedback.
- **Incremental Retraining**: The model can be fine-tuned based on feedback to improve accuracy.
- **Containerized Deployment**: The entire application runs inside Docker containers for seamless deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Front-End**: Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Virtual Environment**: Conda
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilippoRomeo/mnist.git
cd mnist
```
### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
touch .env
```

```ini
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=mnist_db
DB_USER=youruser
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

If using Docker, the prerequisites and db will be set up automatically when starting the containers.

1. ### Run the Application with Docker

Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. ### Run the application with Conda envirorment 

    - Ensure you have the following installed:

        - Python 3.x
        - Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
        - Docker & Docker Compose
        - PostgreSQL

    - #### Set Up the Conda Environment

Create and activate the Conda virtual environment:

```bash
conda create --name mnist-env python=3.12
conda activate mnist-env
```

- #### Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- #### Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

If you are running PostgreSQL locally, create the database:

```bash
psql -U youruser -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mnist_db;"
```

Run the database schema initialization script:

```bash
psql -U youruser -d mnist_db -f init.sql
```

- #### Access the Application

Once the containers are running, open your browser and go to:

[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database stores predictions and feedback:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS predictions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    predicted_digit INTEGER NOT NULL,
    true_label INTEGER NOT NULL,
    image BYTEA NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    feedback_processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Train the Model

The training script is executed automatically by `app.py`. However, you can manually train the model if needed:

```bash
python train.py
```

## Deployment

To deploy the application on a self-managed server:

1. Set up the server and install Docker.
2. Clone the repository onto the server.
3. Configure environment variables.
4. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the app.
5. Ensure the app is accessible via a public IP or domain.
